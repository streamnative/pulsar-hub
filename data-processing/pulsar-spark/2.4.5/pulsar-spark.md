Pulsar Spark Connector is an integration of [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/en/) and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) (data processing engine), which allows Spark reading data from Pulsar and writing data to Pulsar using Spark structured streaming and Spark SQL and provides exactly-once source semantics and at-least-once sink semantics.
