StreamNative develops and maintains Pulsar Spark Connector, a unified data processing with Apache Pulsar and Apache Spark, to allow Spark reading data from Pulsar and writing data to Pulsar.

Pulsar Spark Connector enables you to use Spark structured streaming and Spark SQL to access Pulsar data and provides exactly-once source semantics and at-least-once sink semantics.
