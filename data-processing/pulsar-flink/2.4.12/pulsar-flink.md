StreamNative develops and maintains Pulsar Flink Connector, an elastic data processing with Apache Pulsar and Apache Flink, to allow Flink reading data from Pulsar and writing data to Pulsar.

Pulsar Flink Connector enables you to use Flink to access Pulsar data and provides exactly-once source semantics and at-least-once sink semantics.
