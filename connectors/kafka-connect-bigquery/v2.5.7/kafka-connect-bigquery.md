`kafka-connect-bigquery` is a Kafka Connect connector for Google BigQuery. It is available in the StreamNative Cloud.

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required before setting up the BigQuery connector.

1. A valid Google Cloud account authorized for resource creation.
2. A BigQuery project, which can be set up via the Google Cloud Console.
3. A dataset within the BigQuery project.
4. A service account with access to the BigQuery project that hosts the dataset; this account can be created in the Google Cloud Console.
5. Ensure the service account is granted access to the BigQuery project containing the dataset; create and download a key in JSON format when setting up the service account.
6. According to `GCP specifications <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control>`, the service account will either need the **BigQueryEditor** primitive IAM role or the **bigquery.dataEditor** predefined IAM role. The minimum permissions are as follows:
```
   bigquery.datasets.get
   bigquery.tables.create
   bigquery.tables.get
   bigquery.tables.getData
   bigquery.tables.list
   bigquery.tables.update
   bigquery.tables.updateData
```

### Configuration

The `kafka-connect-bigquery` connector is configured using the following properties:

This property should only be enabled for Schema Registry-based inputs: Avro, Protobuf, or JSON Schema (JSON_SR). Table creation is not supported for JSON input.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | true                                                              |

The string representation of the Google credentials file is supported in BigQuery sink connector version 1.3 (and later). For StreamNative Cloud, the keyfile will be saved as StreamNative Cloud secret in JSON format                                                                      |                                                                   |

| gcsBucketName                        | The name of the bucket where Google Cloud Storage (GCS) blobs are located. These blobs are used to batch-load to BigQuery. This is applicable only if `enableBatchLoad` is configured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                   |
| queueSize                            | The maximum size (or -1 for no maximum size) of the worker queue for BigQuery write requests before all topics are paused.

| bigQueryPartitionDecorator           | Whether or not to append partition decorator to BigQuery table name when inserting records. Default is true. Setting this to true appends partition decorator to table name (e.g. table$yyyyMMdd depending on the configuration set for bigQueryPartitionDecorator). Setting this to false bypasses the logic to append the partition decorator and uses raw table name for inserts.                                         | true                                                              |

Note that in version 2.0.0, SchemaRetriever API changed to retrieve the schema from each SinkRecord, which will help support multiple schemas per topic. SchemaRegistrySchemaRetriever has been removed as it retrieves schema based on the topic.                                                                                       | com.wepay.kafka.connect.bigquery.retrieve.IdentitySchemaRetriever |
